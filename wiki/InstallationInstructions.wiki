The recommended way to install kruX and keep up to date with any future versions is via the subversion system. If you are unfamiliar with this, see [http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html here] for a list of relevant software clients. Detailed instructions for how to checkout kruX can be found under the [https://code.google.com/p/krux/source/checkout Source] tab. If you prefer not to use subversion, we provide prepackaged files for download as well (see below).

After checking out kruX via subversion, there will be a new directory called "kruX"
