# krux

kruX is a software  for identifying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that uses matrix multiplications to simultaneously calculate the Kruskal-Wallis test statistic for several millions of marker-trait combinations at once.

Details are described in the paper: [kruX: matrix-based non-parametric eQTL discovery](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-15-11)
